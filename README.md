# ModularPathFinding
A C++ library for plug-play path finding with grid-based maps

# How to use
Simply include "PathAlgo.h" and you're good to go. Your state manager will have to be configured to be able to switch the active path find module. You will also have to discretise your map into a nodemap (two-dimensional vector of NODE*).
